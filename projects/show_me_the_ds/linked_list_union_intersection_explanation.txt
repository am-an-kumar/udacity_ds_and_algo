union()
=================
There are 2 linked lists say L1 and L2
Let size(L1) = m, and size(L2) = l

Creating lists = O(m) + O(l)
Creating set of both = O(m+l)
Creating list back = O(m+l)
Creating a linked list from this list = O(m+l)

let m+l = n, total number of nodes combined. 
Then, time complexity = O(n)

intersection
==================
Same as above, complexity = O(n)

The actual runtime will be less for intersection as the number of elements will be less in this case, but both methods will be of linear complexity
