Time complexity - For a particular autocomplete suggestion, we do 2 things: -
1. Go to that Trie node
2. Search for all complete words under the subtree of the TrieNode

Worst case scenario is when we are looking for all the possibilites, so the whole Trie Tree will have to searched in that case.

Worst case time complexity = O(n)
