Square root of a number is a number less than half of it. I used this fact to initialize a search space from 0 to half of the number. I take the middle number, square it to see if it is the square root. The search either completes or the search space is reduced to half, like binary search


Time complexity = O(log(n)), binary search like algorithm
Space complexity = O(1), declared a few variables
